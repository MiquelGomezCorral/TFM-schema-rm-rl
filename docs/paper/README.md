# Paper evidence

Results worth citing in the paper: pages with visual proof, the data behind them, and the
scripts that reproduce them. Each entry is one folder that opens on its own from disk, with a
note below.

## How entries get here

- When work produces something worth citing (a before/after page, a measured result, a figure,
  a decisive check), the agent proposes it. It is copied here only after Miquel agrees.
- An entry keeps its page or figures, the inputs and script to rerun it, and a note here: what
  it shows, the evidence, the files, how to rerun it, and the code it refers to.
- Agent pages under `.git/agent-memory/artifacts/` are working copies and may be cleaned up.
  This folder is the copy that lasts.

### Start-state merge (`start-merge/`), 2026-10-13

**What it shows.** MONA gives each rule clause's automaton a start state that exists only before
the first step. The reward layer drops that state when nothing comes back to it and it moves
exactly like its idle successor on every input. The RM is the same machine with one state fewer,
and every reward stays the same. This is not minimisation: only the start can go, and only into
its idle successor.

**Evidence.**
- 25 sample RMs from the reward-layer test, each shown before, expected (before with the start
  removed) and got (what the compiler now writes): 25/25 match. 19 lose exactly one state, which
  is every task with a rule clause; the 6 goal-only RMs are unchanged.
- The check walks the expected and the new RM side by side on every input and pairs their states
  one to one: same rewards, same final and well, same state count.
- The code review also compiled 3,512 clause sets with and without the merge: identical rewards,
  finals and wells. The 253 reward-step checks (every episode total) still pass.

**Files.**
- `index.html`: open it in a browser. Six examples, before / expected / got. Each graph is the
  live RM component: drag a state, click an edge for its cases, Ctrl + scroll to zoom. The "RM
  text" fold-out under each graph has the exact transitions.
- `graphs/`: each of the 18 graphs as live HTML, SVG and RM text.
- `compare.txt`: the check's output for all 25 RMs. `data.json`: the page's content.
- `check/`: the check script, the 25 RMs from before the change (`before/`) and from after it
  (`after/`).

**Rerun** from the repository root, inside `RM_RL_env`:

```bash
PYTHONPATH=app python -W ignore docs/paper/start-merge/check/start_merge_check.py compare \
  docs/paper/start-merge/check/before docs/paper/start-merge/check/after <output dir>
```

It prints one line per RM and ends with `25/25 RMs match the expected merge`; it also writes
the three drawings per RM into `<output dir>`.

**Code.** Commit `9b793a8` (`feat(compiler): drop the duplicate start state`),
`_drop_pre_step_start` in `app/src/compiler/reward_layer.py`; the design is in
`docs/COMPILER_REWARD_DESIGN.md`. The graphs were drawn with the interactive graph and layout
code of 2026-10-14, which was not yet committed when this copy was made; the check does not
depend on the drawing.
